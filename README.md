# Food Rescue & Redistribution System

A full-stack, modular, role-based web application connecting **Food Donors, NGOs, Volunteers, and Administrators** to eliminate food waste and deliver surplus meals to people in need.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **Role-Based Portals** — separate dashboards and permissions for Donors, NGOs, Volunteers, and Admin (JWT + CAPTCHA + RBAC guards on every endpoint)
- **Expiry Validation (FSSAI-aligned)** — donations carry preparation & best-before times; every donation is flagged **FRESH / EXPIRING SOON (≤ 2 h) / EXPIRED** on read. Expired food is blocked from NGO requests and delivery confirmations *server-side*
- **Proximity Matcher** — the admin's assignment screen lists approved volunteers **ranked nearest-first** (haversine distance from each volunteer's latest live GPS ping to the donation pickup pin), with km shown, `NO LIVE PING` / `NO LOCATION` markers, and manual override always possible. Pickup distance is recorded in the audit log
- **Enforced Delivery Workflow** — status transitions *Assigned → Accepted → Picked Up → Out for Delivery → Delivered* are validated server-side (no skipping or going backwards), with race protection on assignment acceptance
- **Resource Ownership Guards** — volunteers can only respond to / update / upload proof for their own assignments; NGOs can only confirm their own deliveries
- **Live Tracking & Proof** — HTML5 Geolocation broadcasting, Leaflet/OpenStreetMap live maps, delivery proof photo uploads, beneficiary-count confirmation ("Mark as Done NGO OK")
- **Analytics & Audit** — auto-computed impact metrics (deliveries, beneficiaries, food saved), monthly CSV report export, and audit logs that record actions including pickup distances

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS, React Router DOM, Axios, Recharts, Leaflet & React-Leaflet, Lucide Icons
- **Backend**: Python Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy ORM, Flask-JWT-Extended, Flask-CORS, Werkzeug Password Hashing
- **Database**: SQLite (`database/food_rescue.db`) — geospatial distances computed in Python (haversine), no extra DB extensions needed
- **Authentication**: Username, Password, 5-digit CAPTCHA Code, JWT Authentication with Role-Based Route Guards
- **Tracking & Maps**: HTML5 Geolocation API (`navigator.geolocation.watchPosition`), Leaflet OpenStreetMap Tiles
- **Notifications**: In-App Notification Center & Mock SMS Dispatcher (with optional Twilio integration)

## 🚀 Quick Setup & Local Running Instructions

### 1. Backend Server Setup

```bash
cd backend
python seed.py        # Initializes SQLite database & populates demo accounts
python run.py         # Launches Flask REST API server on http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

### 2. Frontend Web Application Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install           # Installs React, Vite, Leaflet, Recharts, Lucide dependencies
npm run dev           # Starts Vite Development Server on http://localhost:3000
```

> Re-running `python seed.py` resets the database to the demo state. The seed includes
> donations in all three expiry states (fresh, expiring-soon, expired) and volunteers
> with live GPS pings so the proximity matcher and expiry badges are demonstrable.

```

1. **Donor**: Posts surplus food with photos, pickup coordinates, and preparation/expiry times. Status is **Donation Available**.
2. **NGOs (NGO 1, 2, 3)**: All NGOs can view available food batches with FSSAI expiry & safety badges.
3. **One NGO Accepts**: The first NGO to inspect and accept claims the donation (**NGO Accepted**). Other NGOs are prevented from duplicate claims via atomic 409 Conflict race guards.
4. **Notify ALL Volunteers**: Automated broadcast notification and SMS alert is immediately dispatched to **ALL** approved volunteers.
5. **Volunteers (Volunteer 1, 2, 3)**: All volunteers see the open delivery task in their broadcast feed.
6. **First Volunteer Accepts**: First volunteer to accept claims the task (**Volunteer Assigned**). Subsequent claims by other volunteers are rejected with 409 Conflict.
7. **Pickup & Delivery**: Volunteer marks **Picked Up** $\rightarrow$ **Out for Delivery** $\rightarrow$ uploads proof photo for **Delivered**.
8. **NGO Receives & Beneficiaries**: NGO inspects the delivery proof, confirms receipt (**NGO OK**), and records total beneficiary count (**Completed**).
9. **Admin**: Monitors all activities, live GPS locations, fulfillment statuses, impact analytics, and audit logs.
